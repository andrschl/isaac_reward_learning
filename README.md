Library for inverse reinforcement learning and RLHF for robotic manipulation.

## Installation
1. Install IsaacLab v2.0 following the instructions in on the [IsaacLab documentation](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/v2.0.2/source/setup/installation/index.html).
2. Clone this repository
3. Activate the virtual environment with the isaaclab installation and `run python -m pip install -e source/isaac_reward_learning`

## Training
